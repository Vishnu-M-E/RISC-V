This chapter took a slight detour to explain the underlying foundation of raw machine instructions. Programming languages are portable and can be run on any CPU hardware. This is made possible by the Instruction set architecture (ISA). The CPU executes row machine instructions that have been encoded into bits as defined by an ISA. The familiar compiler does the job of translating a program's source code into a binary file.
